  *what is the 'class' attribute in HTML? 
  
 The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.
 The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. 
 However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) 
 to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
